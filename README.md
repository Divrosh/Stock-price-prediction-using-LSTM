Predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in Python typically involves a series of steps, including data preparation, model building, and evaluation. Below is a simplified example of how you can create a stock price prediction model using LSTM with the help of the Keras library. Please note that this is a basic example, and real-world applications may require more advanced techniques, data preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning.

First, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
```

Now, here's a Python code example for stock price prediction using LSTM:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load your stock price data (adjust the filename and data format as needed)
data = pd.read_csv("your_stock_data.csv")
data = data['Close'].values.reshape(-1, 1)

# Normalize the data to a range between 0 and 1
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
train_size = int(len(data) * 0.80)
train_data, test_data = data[:train_size], data[train_size:]

# Create sequences of historical data for training
def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
    sequences = []
    for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
        x = data[i:i+seq_length]
        y = data[i+seq_length]
        sequences.append((x, y))
    return np.array(sequences)

seq_length = 10
train_sequences = create_sequences(train_data, seq_length)
test_sequences = create_sequences(test_data, seq_length)

# Build the LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, activation='relu', input_shape=(seq_length, 1)))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(train_sequences[:,0], train_sequences[:,1], epochs=100, batch_size=64)

# Evaluate the model
test_inputs = test_sequences[:,0]
predicted_stock_prices = model.predict(test_inputs)
predicted_stock_prices = scaler.inverse_transform(predicted_stock_prices)

# Visualize the results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(data, label='Actual Stock Prices', color='b')
plt.plot(range(train_size + seq_length, len(data)), predicted_stock_prices, label='Predicted Stock Prices', color='r')
plt.title('Stock Price Prediction')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Stock Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

In this code:

1. Load your stock price data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Normalize the data to ensure it's within a reasonable range.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Create sequences of historical data, which will be used as input for the LSTM model.
5. Build an LSTM model with one or more layers.
6. Train the model using the training sequences.
7. Use the trained model to predict stock prices on the testing data.
8. Visualize the actual and predicted stock prices.

Remember that this is a simple example, and real-world applications may require more data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy.
